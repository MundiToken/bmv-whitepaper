# üßò‚ôÄ Balance & Hedging

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Economy Balance control**</mark>

The same concept will apply to MDTCoin for the Mintin & Unminting process in order to control inflation and currency deflation. One of the main objectives is to control the "whales" that are characterized by buying a large majority of the tokens to generate a contained demand and cause the price of the token to increase.

Thanks to the OBVMA algorithm, which can be executed every hour or twice a day, it will examine how many tokens were issued and analyze the balance of each one of the portfolios. If one of the portfolios has more than X percent (it was thought in 20%) of the total of **MDTCoin**, the strategy will be to perform a delta minting that the "whale" has. That is, if a portfolio makes a purchase of 18% of total tokens in less than a day, OBVMA will realize a mint of between 10-18% to compensate that purchase and avoid that there is a contained demand that could risk that the token becomes a speculative and highly variable asset.

At the moment that the "whale" releases the tokens, the same algorithm will analyze the amount of daily movement of tokens and send them to the central bank to carry out a process of destruction or expiration. These tokens can enter a state of "limbo" waiting to be released to compensate the purchase of another "whale" or deliver it to users gradually, following demand policies for the organic growth of the economy.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Burn Policy</mark>

‚ÄúBurning‚Äù **MDTCoin** means permanently removing a number of tokens from circulation. This is typically done by transferring the tokens in question to a burn address, i.e. a wallet from which they cannot ever be retrieved. This is often described as destroying tokens. A project burns its tokens to reduce the overall supply. In other words, it creates a "deflationary" event.

Burning will take MDTCoins are purchased too be consumed. Burning events will be registered by BMV and updated the core system for internal balance UCS sheets.

All the MDTCoins that are assigned to the lot will be made available, in no longer than a year, in the certification on-line platforms where it is consumed;

The price of the token does not necessarily increase when the burn takes place. Sometimes, other news or indexes related to the token can. Burning tokens tend to support an asset‚Äôs price and is considered a positive move as business evolves.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Tragedy of the commons prevention</mark>

In economic science, the **tragedy of the commons** is a situation in which individual users, who have open access to a resource unhampered by shared social structures or formal rules that govern access and use, act independently according to their own self interest and, contrary to the common good of all users, cause depletion of the resource through their uncoordinated action.

A rival good means that only one person can consume an asset and, when someone consumes a unit that unit is no longer available for others to consume.&#x20;

All consumers migth become rivals competing for that asset and each person‚Äôs consumption subtracts from the total stock of the good available. Note that in order for a tragedy for the commons to occur the asset must also be scarce like a token, since a non-scarce good cannot be rivalrous in consumption.
