# ðŸ“£ ICO and Offseting

### ICO <a href="#_toc39513924" id="_toc39513924"></a>

All the amount gathered in the ICO will be directed at the purchase of UCS . Each Token will be made of an individual lot of 1 UCS, to be made available in the Green Treasure Platform, 1 year from the moment the Initial Coin Offering is complete.

### Offsetting

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

(1) BMV Portugal issues Munditokens corresponding to 1/10th of the number UCS to be bought after the ICO. Purchasers subscribe Tokens by delivering ETH or Stable Coins. In the specified delivery date, the Issuer provides the Purchaser with Tokens;

(1.1) The revenues of the sale of UCS are immediately destinated to the BMV Participants, i.e. already from the ICO the Projects are benefited;

(2) The Munditoken holders can use their Munditokens to offset their environmental footprint. For that purpose, they can use one of the verified Socio Environmental Quota or CRS calculator available in the platforms that are authorized by BMV listed below. After calculation, the holder can use their Tokens to offset their footprint.

(3) After validation of the calculation and digital transaction, the holder will be granted a Certificate, declaring that its environmental footprint has been offset. This certification is granted upon the certified and verified methodologies used by BMV

(4) For each Token used for the offset, 10 UCS are retired from the distributed ledger registry, which avoids risks of double counting.

* The Token is backed by a financial and environmental asset, different from the most part of offered Tokens that have no intrinsic value;
* Access to the increasingly growing market of environmental assets, driven by structured demand of public policies or voluntary offsetting;
* Immediate financing of forest conservation projects in Brazil and Europe, with real and concrete co-benefits for the surrounding communities.
* Offsetting its own environmental footprint;
* The prices of environmental assets can be volatile. The Token grants right to 10 UCS at the present fixed price.
