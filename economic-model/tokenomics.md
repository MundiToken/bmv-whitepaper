# üíµ Tokenomics

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Utility tokens**</mark>

Utility tokens are one of the types of cryptographic tokens. They are tokens that give their holders access to a blockchain-based product or service. The asset they represent is a certain level of access to a service or product that the holder can obtain by redeeming it.&#x20;

For example, Matic or Ether can be exchanged for access to decentralized applications (dApps) or to pay for smart contracts to be executed on the Polygon blockchain.&#x20;

The Ethereum and Smart Contract became more popular as the creation of dapps grew exponentially, usually in the form of ICOs. However, after several controversies from the offering of Utility Tokens, the general trust in this type of crypto assets has been put into question. The main characteristic of a Utility Token as offered by the ICOs is that it provides access to some kind of decentralized application (the so called ‚Äúutility‚Äù) and its value is based solely in the initial offering and subsequent transactions among private individuals. The main difference of our Token to others is that we have substance to back it. The already existent and used Forest Credits, which provides access to the offsetting of the environmental footprint for businesses and individuals that choose to do so.

BMV provenance systems operates through cyclic token economy, using ERC-20 utility knowns as **MDTCoins or Mundi Tokens** for services liquidation as well and governance.

{% endhint %}

**The total number (cap) of MDTCoins economy will not be established.** Minting (current and total supply) will occur automatically in response to the core certification business and following business strategy based on special financial incentives. On Volume Balance analysis will be checked in order to maintain economy inflation not raising a starting level of 10%.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Governance tokens</mark>

DApps are typically designed to be self-sufficient and not reliant on a central authority. However in practice decisions often need to be made about changes in the operation of DApp and those changes need to be implemented.

Many DApps solve this through the use of admin keys, which allow certain individuals to update the underlying smart contracts. However this introduces security risks and also undermines a DApp‚Äôs level of decentralization, which can have regulatory consequences. A common solution is to allow holders of a DApp‚Äôs governance tokens to vote on key decisions. These tokens are typically issued to users of the DApp, based on their level of activity. A smart contract-based decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is established as part of the DApp, which executes the governance decisions of the token holders ‚Äî removing part of the need for ‚Äúadmins‚Äù.

Governance tokens will be distributed following a pre-set MDTCoin stakers reule (to be determined).

These tokens may be tradeable on exchanges (including DEXs), with their value presumably linked to the ability to influence the operation of a specific DApp, but still free to market and not tied to BMV business financial results or MDTCoin pricing.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</mark>

Our Initial Coin Offering presents the opportunity for accessing an environmental asset, backed by financial assets, which has a real, ‚Äòbricks-and-mortars‚Äô value, through a digital and secure environment. Every Token holder will be able to access the platforms where the UCS are deposited and offset their impact easily.

In our case, the ICO is based on a smart contract, giving investors access to the Tokens after ETH or StableCoins of Euro (‚Ç¨) purchases. The token will rely on the Ethereum Network, the most well established and used smart contract technology so far.

The initial token sale process includes the issuing of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFT), followed by and Initial Token Sale to distribute **MDTCoins** (see [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")) to buyers.

The revenue of the sales will be finally credited in the Issuer accounts managed by BMV, where it may be converted in ETH or Stable Coin (‚Ç¨), depending on the issuers prefference.

The **MDTCoins** purchased will generate revenue for the BMV Participants and will be used:

‚¶Å To support the global operations structure, namely (i) in the expansion of the capacity and customization of the registry platform to accommodate other international environmental assets; (ii) improvements in the physical structure of the European branch, as well to support required technical and legal fees and; (iii) Inventory and methodological customization to originate European stocks

‚¶Å Viability of the Projects which conciliate the keeping of native forest with financing of equipment and input for sustainable production;

‚¶Å Development of communities in the areas comprehended within the Projects, e.g. education development; professional and cultural exchange; scholarship within the partnership between UNESP and Instituto Polit√©cnico de Coimbra (and other joining institutes); knowledge and technology exchange in order to qualify young professionals in Sustainable Development and Production;

‚¶Å Building the agile acceleration for new functionalities of the BMV Dapp and smart contracts engine, marketing presence and building the partners and customers community that leverages its growth and liquidates its token.

{% endhint %}

The final sale price of **MDTCoins** during the ICO is not pre-determined.

Part of the income from the Token Sale by the BMV will fund the development of a **MDTCoin** a wallet engine as well. This wallet will manage the fees and accounting services, conversion between **MDTCoins,** UCS operations **** and Fiat Currencies, other Cryptocurrencies, payments, liquidation, staking, etc.&#x20;

The wallet may function as an independent subsidiary of BMV. In order to allow the operation liquidity for the exchange process, BMV will be funded with 10,000 of **MDTCoins**(\~0.01% of total Tokens available).

BMV will maintain 673,000 **MDTCoins** will be committed to the development of market Applications committed to use **MDTCoins** as their unique value exchange instrument. An example description of such DAPP (Distribuited Application) can be found on the accompanying documentation of this White Paper.

These tokens will be also used to support the **MDTCoins** exclusive operations education sites, videos, blogs and social media posts, marketing  as well as broaden the carbon credit economic spectrum.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Initial Token Sale</mark>

The Initial Token Sale for MDTCoin may follow an Interactive mechanism as described by Teutsch and Buterin. Price of acquisition will be determined by the final valuation of the token at the end of the sale as determined by market demand. Nevertheless, significant savings will be obtained by early contributors, particularly in the SAFT phase, with up to 40% discounts for initial investors in the SAFT when compared to a Secondary Sale (I-ICO model), and subsequent discounts weaning down by the end of the Token Sale process (see [ico-and-offseting.md](ico-and-offseting.md "mention") for futher details on the process).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important to know:** <mark style="color:blue;">The lowest price at which a MDTCoins will be able to be obtained is at an equivalent of R$ 175.00 per token, during the limited SAFT offering of the BMV Consortium</mark>
{% endhint %}

| Item                | Definitions                           | MDTCoins      | %       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| SAFT and Token Sale | Initial Token Sale - Discount applied | 100.000.000   | 10      |
| Secondary Sale      | Interactive-ICO - Market capped price | 50.000.000    | 5       |
| Reserves            | Not minted                            | 850.000.000   | 85      |
| **Total**           | **CAP**                               | **1.000.000** | **100** |

### <mark style="color:purple;">Secondary Token Sale</mark>

In this model, we wish to achieve a market equilibrium through buyer interactions. Buyers not only submit bids for tokens but may also voluntarily withdraw their bids after committing them to the sale (within certain limits). In addition, each buyer submits to the crowdsale smart contract a valuation table which maps total sale amounts to the buyer‚Äôs contribution amount.

The smart contract continuously and automatically withdraws bids according to the present bids and valuation tables. Our implementation introduces incentives which enable the smart contract to manage the complex operations of adding, deleting, and finding the minimum value in a list as well as identifying a subset of entries whose sum exceeds a target value.

**The sale wil represent a xx% of the total economy (soft cap)**

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Economy Balance control**</mark>

The same concept will apply to MDTCoin for the Mintin & Unminting process in order to control inflation and currency deflation. One of the main objectives is to control the "whales" that are characterized by buying a large majority of the tokens to generate a contained demand and cause the price of the token to increase.

Thanks to the OBVMA algorithm, which can be executed every hour or twice a day, it will examine how many tokens were issued and analyze the balance of each one of the portfolios. If one of the portfolios has more than X percent (it was thought in 20%) of the total of **MDTCoin**, the strategy will be to perform a delta minting that the "whale" has. That is, if a portfolio makes a purchase of 18% of total tokens in less than a day, OBVMA will realize a mint of between 10-18% to compensate that purchase and avoid that there is a contained demand that could risk that the token becomes a speculative and highly variable asset.

At the moment that the "whale" releases the tokens, the same algorithm will analyze the amount of daily movement of tokens and send them to the central bank to carry out a process of destruction or expiration. These tokens can enter a state of "limbo" waiting to be released to compensate the purchase of another "whale" or deliver it to users gradually, following demand policies for the organic growth of the economy.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Inflation</mark>

### <mark style="color:purple;">Burn Policy</mark>

‚ÄúBurning‚Äù **MDTCoin** means permanently removing a number of tokens from circulation. This is typically done by transferring the tokens in question to a burn address, i.e. a wallet from which they cannot ever be retrieved. This is often described as destroying tokens. A project burns its tokens to reduce the overall supply. In other words, it creates a "deflationary" event.

Burning will take MDTCoins are purchased too be consumed. Burning events will be registered by BMV and updated the core system for internal balance UCS sheets.

All the MDTCoins that are assigned to the lot will be made available, in no longer than a year, in the certification on-line platforms where it is consumed;

The price of the token does not necessarily increase when the burn takes place. Sometimes, other news or indexes related to the token can. Burning tokens tend to support an asset‚Äôs price and is considered a positive move as business evolves.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Tragedy of the commons prevention</mark>

In economic science, the **tragedy of the commons** is a situation in which individual users, who have open access to a resource unhampered by shared social structures or formal rules that govern access and use, act independently according to their own self interest and, contrary to the common good of all users, cause depletion of the resource through their uncoordinated action.
