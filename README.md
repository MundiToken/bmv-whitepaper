### <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark>

The debate around the impact of human existence on Earth is no new to us. Countless conferences, specialized debates and conventions have already taken place focusing specifically on the impacts, in what magnitudes and for what duration phenomena such as climate change, ocean acidification and the destruction of tropical forests occur.

It is difficult today, even for the most fervent of denialists, to argue that Humanity has not left permanent marks on Earth. Relatively permanent, of course. After all, the emergence of terrestrial life itself is a more or less delicate fact, so all evidence of our existence has a deadline between 5 and 7 billion years, when astronomers believe that the Sun will expand and consume our rocky little planet.

However, until that happens, there will be an infinity of evidence of a species that in the short period between its differentiation from its peers ‚Äì all extinct, which increases our naive impression of being superior or special, but that is another discussion ‚Äì, around 1.8 million years ago, to the development of large-scale agricultural technologies that more or less permanently altered entire biomes, our brief but memorable visit to the Moon, and the deposition of plastic waste in the oceans in a mass already comparable to that of the Earth. total fish, for example.

Some scientists already defend that this period is called Anthropocene, because there will be evidence even at the geological level (that of fossils and oil) for example ‚Äì that we were here. Some rightly point to agriculture or the intensity of carbon emitted since we mastered fossil fuels, but perhaps the most emblematic is to look at the radioisotopes that spread through the atmosphere and deposited around the world after the use of nuclear bombs, whether over civilians or in land and ocean tests. It is emblematic precisely because it is impossible for it to occur naturally. It's tempting to imagine an alien archaeologist from the future (or the equivalent expert then) reaching the startling conclusion that it could only have been done by someone with some degree of consciousness, intelligence, scientific advancement, and material support.

This narrative, somewhat dark and disillusioned, has characterized the way we see human influence on Earth. Debates among environmentalists often have, with frightening frequency, this alarmist and urgent undertone. And we really need to be on alert, even to try to correct mistakes and improve successes. But is it possible to build a different world? To radically alter this narrative and ensure our own permanence? As a species, of course, as individually we rarely live past one hundred years. Another way of asking this question could be: how to build a future when the present seems to be falling apart over our heads?

Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky, a mineralogist and geochemist of Ukrainian origin and born in the Russian Empire, proposed that the Earth went through three stages: the Geosphere, from the moment that the gases that formed it condensed by gravity until the Earth's crust cooled; the Biosphere, characterized by the appearance of life on the surface and which began to carry out important biochemical exchanges that are increasingly complex and which altered the planetary system and the atmosphere; finally, the Noosphere, characterized by the emergence of an animal species that is capable of altering entire landscapes and moving considerable masses with its ingenuity. Yes we.

The Greek prefix noos- can be translated as ‚Äúreason‚Äù or ‚Äúmind‚Äù, while -sphere seems more intuitive, as it suggests the globe shape of our planet. This idea seems to allow, given its apparent neutrality of judgment in relation to the human impact on the Earth, a historical reading and a more optimistic projection of the future. It allows us to envision the collective use of our ingenuity and cognitive capacity to build a better future. Where technology and human learning are used to make a positive impact, reintroducing us to the natural system and creating the possibility of a conscious stakeholder role.

Other animals influence entire ecosystems, as is the case with the death of a whale, an event called in English ‚Äúwhalefall‚Äù, when one of these magnificent animals dies and sinks into the ocean, its corpse sustains a biological community for up to 50 years. We can also mention the extensive underground networks of fungi that allow communication between trees of the same species, and sometimes of different species, constituting the forests in an immense community for thousands of years. ‚ÄãWould it be too much of an illusion to dream of a time when man would step down from his self-proclaimed pedestal among other forms of life and integrate himself into nature, improving it and not just ‚Äúmitigating impacts‚Äù, as some carbon market activists defend today?

The Russian ecologist Victor Vasilievich Petrashov argued as early as 1993 that we can establish the so-called noocenoses (we have already discussed the meaning of noos- above, the suffix -koinos can be translated as ‚Äúcommon, mutual, shared‚Äù), a second-order biosphere where a human and non-human community ‚Äì animals and other life forms ‚Äì would constitute an artificial biological community on top of a degraded ecosystem.

Changing into kids, a place where the destroyed nature would be reconstituted by humans and other beings, not only being recovered, but improved. It sounds like fantasy, but there is solid science behind this thinking. When we remove our arrogance and all the aesthetic exuberance that we project with our gaze on nature, we understand that from the smallest virus to the largest blue whale and passing through all 7 billion human beings, we are all simply complex organic molecules carrying out chemical exchanges with the environment around us.

And that is carbon, the same element of the fearsome petroleum and even more fearsome natural coal and the same element that is in the steel that we use in the industry and that constitutes the trunk of any tree and all the strands of its hair. When we think in this way, it is possible to introduce management concepts, even accounting, to better deal with the consequences of our production processes, whether agricultural, industrial, artisanal or simply everyday.

This can be our contribution. These communities, resulting from a new human consciousness, more mature and effective even, may allow us to move away from the inevitable sinking of the Anthropocene towards an earthly age marked by rational improvement: an age called the Noocene.
