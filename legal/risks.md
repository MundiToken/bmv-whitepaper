# ðŸš¨ Risks

As per the content of this White Paper, it is intended that Token holders will be eligible to receive payments from the Issuer upon determination of a distribution to Token holders by the directors of the Issuer. However, as per these risk factors, the Issuers may never make a profit or have any funds available to make a distribution to Token holders. Furthermore, it is possible that Token holders will be ineligible to receive any payout due to the determinations of the Issuer including, for example, where Token holders have not provided KYC for AML purposes or where Token holders are citizens or residents in those restricted jurisdictions as determined by the Issuer.

Furthermore, any payout shall be subject to the designation terms of the Token holders as a class of beneficiary of the Issuer. Such terms may restrict payments by the Issuer under certain circumstances or restrict certain Token holders to any payout where such payment would not be in the best interests of the Issuer or would be in breach of any laws or regulations. Furthermore, the directors have the power to determine that profits of the Issuer may be used for reinvestment or any other purpose (such as satisfying any liabilities) and therefore may choose not to make any distribution to Token holders during the time that the holder holds the Tokens. Additionally, the Token holder may trade or transfer the Tokens and therefore may lose all rights to any distribution following such trade.
