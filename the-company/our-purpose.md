# ðŸ§­ Our Purpose

### <mark style="color:purple;">Forehand words</mark>

Our purpose is to structure sustainable development projects focused on identifying, minimizing and mitigating climate risks, which play a major role in stimulating the economy, lifting people out of the poverty line and improving health, while increasing the vital benefits of nature.

The BMV Group, working together with universities, independent technicians and market structurers, developed the methodology and technology to measure and quantify the benefits of conservation and environmental protection, which have been converted into a tradeable product and a financial asset.

BMTCA is one of the groupâ€™s enterprises and performs the connection function with the demand and manages the platform that distributes the codes and blocks representing the UCS in sub-platforms, to meet demand from voluntary use and public benefit programs.

These benefits programs encourage businesses and individuals to take social and environmental responsibility as the Forest Credits are consumed, fomenting the sustainable development in rural communities.

From the platforms, one can acquire UCSs, which represent these Forest Credits and be granted with the right to use the electronic Sustainability Seal, attesting that this business has shared the effort of preservation. That gives one the access to a range of public incentives policies, besides the image boost associated.

And it is there that the collaborative network acting on the forestsâ€™ conservation has an outcome objectively availed as the Forest Credit. Therefore, all action developed in regard of this new green economy â€“ from applied human resources to the construction of industry solutions â€“ result in a positive balance of the benefits created by the forest standing.</mark>_
