# üöÄ Blockchain potential

Blockchain is an Open Source platform that has drawn a lot of attention from the markets because it brings clear benefits in terms of time, security, flexibility in implementation and especially transparency in distributed processing and information exchange.

The platform is a community information layer between different systems, processes, people, areas or companies where the information "transmits" as transactions, much like a database, only in the form of messages.

A key component is a centralized, encrypted ledger where network participants can securely validate transactions. With a series of mechanisms, they prevent fraud or the manipulation of information by unauthorized processes or participants. It assumes that if everyone has the same information, a participant should not differ from what is copied between everyone, which makes it humanly impossible to be hacked.

These transactions can contain any type of data, as long as it travels between different participants within a network. This network can be public or private.

The participants of a Blockchain network, regardless of its nature (public or private), must have the power to validate, in an automated way, the blocks of transactions through an algorithm called "consensus". This procedure ensures transactional stability. Additionally, the platform guarantees the privacy of information between participants, as the information transmitted is encrypted. The member (participant) of a Blockchain network is normally an entity that has a valid certificate for participation - applications, users, systems interact with the network through a valid Member.

Additionally, the platform also offers the benefit of being able to develop business rules to be applied to the information that ‚Äútravels‚Äù on the Blockchain.

Traditional systems create islands with their own rules and actors, a good example is a database system. Integrating and sharing information in a transparent, efficient and secure way between several companies (or even between areas ends up not being practical due to the variety of data, the speed and volume of information, so the integration of traditional systems is limited. has transparent, system-independent multi-actor business networks.

Blockchain addresses this demand as it allows us to place a layer of security, transparency and business rules between assets (the goods to be traded) and participants. Additionally, it is not disruptive in technological terms, as it can connect to any system or data source through APIs.

From tracking medical records, controlling parts and maintenance status, selling goods, democratizing financial services, drug or food supply chain, to eliminating intermediaries such as agents, notaries and other entities, Blockchain is a new way for our business relationships.
