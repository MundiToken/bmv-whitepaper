### Economical value for an essential service <a href="#_toc39513909" id="_toc39513909"></a>

The very idea of sustainable development is recent, and the general public still needs some work in order to build a consensus as to its meaning. Furthermore, a commitment with the Environment protection is a comprehensive and broad challenge that carries along the awareness of all the many interdependent parts that form it. This is the challenge that BMV has taken on from the start and been successfully overcoming with technology, knowledge sharing and being in touch with real people.

Farmers are often seen as the bad guys in the environmental debate. There is no room for other conception when dialogue and understanding are not present and many important aspects are just overlooked, and double standards are adopted. Farmers are economical subjects just as any other player in the value chain, thus being subject to economic considerations when making decisions. We could not expect something different from them, especially when the margins are low and the options are not too many. So, how to tip the balance towards the sustainability in agriculture without putting excessive pressure and expecting unreal and illogical attitudes in landowners?

The BMV Methodology has been applied for many years now to tackle this issue at its core: assigning economic value to preservation. The concept is not exclusive, and Payments for Environmental Services is a much-debated idea and present in the main international conventions and commitments over the preservation of tropical forests. However, national governments and international organizations have until now failed to provide the details or features of a mechanism based on this premise. But where theyâ€™ve failed we strive: in close contact and discussion with those that are most able (if not the only) to keep natural resources preserved and to ensure the benefits for overall society.

In a glance our methodology captures the value of the many benefits that encompass preservation, such as carbon stocking, biodiversity, maintenance of the water cycle, the opportunity cost associated and good agricultural practices. It has been developed by BMV and assessed by EYâ„¢.
