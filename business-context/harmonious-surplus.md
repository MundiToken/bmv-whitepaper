# üçÅ Harmonious Surplus

Every economic activity is designed so it generates a surplus, essential for a sustained activity over time. However, it is not every time that the additionality of an activity translates into pure profit, at least partially.

We believe that earnings must derive from ethical decisions and create good externalities other than the earnings themselves. Only contributing to an economic environment that eliminates social distortions and that accounts for the vironment can qualify their positive results and create the pathway to a future where life is respected and the conditions for the very activity are maintained.

This is the reason why we focus our efforts in developing and providing the tools for the sustainability either for farmers or other undertakings.

Farmers need the knowledge and financing to change their practices so that the environment is protected which benefits the society as a whole.

Businesses should take measures to contribute and compensate their impact, social or environmental, not only as a matter of justice, but as a matter of continuity.

Governments must end the systematic short-term decision making and adopt a vision of continuity and long-term results.
