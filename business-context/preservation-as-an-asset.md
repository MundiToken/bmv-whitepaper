# 🌄 Preservation as an asset

This process gives origin to Forest Credits which are incorporated in Sustainability Credit Units – the UCS. This is the asset that is represented by our token and is used for many businesses and individuals for offsetting its environmental impact.

Each time an inventory is made, the units are embodied as a security, the _Cédula de Produto Rural_ (“CPR”)- Rural Product Notes. – which is a title commonly used by farmers in Brazil. That is why the UCS is a financial asset and can be used not only for offsetting the environmental footprint of a company or individual, but also as a collateral for financing, in public bidding offerings as judicial deposits etc. This is a distinguishing factor of the UCS, once it has legal certainty not present in any other environmental asset we’ve seen so far and it presents many options of usage for the demand. However, this is not the only thing that makes it different from the average carbon credit.
