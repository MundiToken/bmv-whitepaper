# üëì Policy and demand

Throughout the whole process of origination of the credits, all relevant legal aspects are analysed into a serious and thorough scrutiny, what gives certainty to all participants ‚Äì from the farmer to consumer ‚Äì of the ownership and subsequent transactions. It‚Äôs based on the concepts provided in the Brazilian Forest Law, which attests the legal form of ‚Äúintangible and tradable assets‚Äù arising from conservation activities. The securities embodying the UCS, the already mentioned CPR, adds an extra layer of certainty. Moreover, the growing number of states and cities that adopt the methodology and the UCS as means of sustainability and environmental policies are good indicators of integrity and efficacy.

From the public hearing, the initial step of the origination process, BMV and UNESP check if the properties are in compliance with the national and local environmental regulation, gather all the available data prior to the project and set a monitoring process for all its length. Elements such as regular ownership, area delimitation through geoprocessing and the Environmental Rural Registry (‚ÄúCAR‚Äù) are verified by a documentational audit in all the deposits of the landowners and determine the eligibility for integration in the project.

After determining the potential of the project in terms of biodiversity preservation and improvement, based on satellite images and in loco verification, important elements such as baseline activity and biologic stocks are assessed for the application of the methodology deposited in the United Nations and other international organizations.

After creation, embodiment and international custody of the Credits, the UCS are made available in the Green Treasure platform and ready to be used for voluntary reasons or to attend a policy requirement.

As stated, many states and cities in Brazil already use the UCS as the main instrument for broader environmental policies designed to create structured demand, encouraging business to take part in the conservation efforts always through incentives, leveraged by the brand and awareness boost that is perceived by businesses with the associated Green Seal, given to those that share the effort of preservation.

To list some of these policies we can name:

In April 8th, 2020, the Brazilian National Congress approved the Law 13.986/2020 that explicitly provides for the conservation of native forests and the respective biomes as a rural product. While it is a major advance in the Brazilian environmental law for the protection of forests in rural properties, it only states what BMV has been doing for years.
