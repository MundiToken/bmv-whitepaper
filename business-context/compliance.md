### <mark style="color:purple;">Transparency is essential for us</mark>

In every step of the process, we make sure that all relevant information is available to all participants, and the best way to do so is relying intensively on technology.

Every UCS that is created is registered in a blockchain registry, kept in the NXT blockchain platform (see [blockchain-potential.md](../blockchain-platform/blockchain-potential.md "mention") for a word on the technology) while the certificate is kept as an NFT (see [nft-certifications.md](../business-accelerators/nft-certifications.md "mention")to understand BMV NFT certification strategy) in the Polygon platform (see [platform-selection.md](../blockchain-platform/platform-selection.md "mention") to understand the Blockchain platform of choice). Both records track of where the unit has been originated, its birthdate, all further transactions and ownership transfers and, finally, when it is retired, meaning that it has been used for offsetting.

This process was created to ensure that there is no double counting or double retirement of any unit. Every time an offsetting is made through an UCS, there is no doubt of its integrity.

As for the purchase of UCS, the process is concluded through many platforms and partners (described below), including an online marketplace the Green Treasure platform (Tesouro Verde in Portuguese), which can be accessed [here](https://www.plataformatesouroverde.com.br/).&#x20;

There, after calculation of the business or individual footprint, the equivalent number of units can be purchased, either for voluntary reasons or following one of the structured demand policies aforementioned. By doing so, the purchaser is awarded the Green Treasure Seal, which attests that its holder has shared the efforts for the preservation and development of the Nuclei communities.

The website also contains a number of relevant information regarding recent transactions, and information about the project that supplied a specific UCS.
