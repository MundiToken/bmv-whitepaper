# ðŸ“ˆ Trends in sustainability

In this scenario, no rock is to be unturned and the major and mainstream investors have already acted. On the eve of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Larry Flink, head of the largest asset manager in the world â€“ Blackrock â€“ announced, both to CEOs and Investors that every decision made by the company would take into account ESG factors. Although it may have come to many as a dramatic shift of discourse from Wall Street, the announcement was very well-grounded: the appetite for mainstream investment in ESG complying companies is soaring as a generation that grew up learning about the impacts of the current economic model on the environment, is now the generation making financial and investment decisions. According to Morningstar, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds with a focus on sustainability grew from $5.5 billion in 2018 to $20.6 billion in 2019 â€“ almost four times in one year.

During the 2019th edition of the WEF in Davos â€“ which carbon footprint was fully neutralized â€“ the importance of ESG factors was also a highlight, next to the awareness of the great importance of the Amazon rainforest to the planet and, therefore, to the whole economy. Leaders from all over the world recognized that action in protecting the most vital biomes in the world and to reduce degradation as a matter of the utmost importance.

However, it should not necessarily be seen as an additional cost or burden to the economy, because there is also room for great opportunity. Besides granting new and eased means of financing, the proper conduction of ESG matters within a business can also enable access to new environmentally aware markets, looking for products that are proven to be beneficial and responsible. There is a head start for those that take responsibility into their own hands right now.
