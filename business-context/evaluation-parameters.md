Within this background the next step is to put all words and numbers into action, and it’s done on a case-by-case basis for each Nucleus. A Nucleus is what we call the association of farmers that had committed to incorporate sustainable practices and to keep all the vegetation within their property intact, so there is a sense of collective responsibility and growing. Every time that farmers gather together to pursue this aim, BMV creates a customized plan, which comprises the collective goals of that Nucleus, how sustainable practices are to be undertaken and other technical and legal issues regarding the land use of every owner. Notwithstanding, it is also a binding agreement of the farmers, association and BMV containing all the rights and obligations necessary to ensure transparency and certainty of all the process.

Then, after determination of the geographic scope of each Nucleus, BMV counts the stocks of Forest Credits through inventory at each area – the Environmental Patrimony. It does so by using methodologies registered within the UN and involves a number of trusted participants to make sure that what’s been counted reflects the natural reality on site. The stock accounting is verified by UNESP, one of the most respected Brazilian universities in the field of land use, forests and agriculture and EY™ assures that the methodology has been employed and observed as it should.
