The BMV Group, working together with universities, independent technicians and market structurers, developed the methodology and technology to measure and quantify the benefits of conservation and environmental protection, which have been converted into a tradeable product and a financial asset.

BMTCA is one of the group‚Äôs enterprises and performs the connection function with the demand and manages the platform that distributes the codes and blocks representing the UCS in sub-platforms, to meet demand from voluntary use and public benefit programs.

These benefits programs encourage businesses and individuals to take social and environmental responsibility as the Forest Credits are consumed, fomenting the sustainable development in rural communities.

From the platforms, one can acquire UCSs, which represent these Forest Credits and be granted with the right to use the electronic Sustainability Seal, attesting that this business has shared the effort of preservation. That gives one the access to a range of public incentives policies, besides the image boost associated.

BMV Portugal is the company responsible for the product offering from Europe and has become the International Investments platform: BMV Global Sustainability. It will be responsible for the Token offering with aim to permit the access of international actors to qualified products, embedded in innovative processes and to create stimulus for businesses looking to offset their footprint and to finance new sustainable projects. Departing from the already well-established Forest Credit, credits focused on the protection of landscape and traditional cultures.
