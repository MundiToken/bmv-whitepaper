# üî∞ Setting the plan

For each Nucleus a Sustainability Development Plan (or ‚ÄúPlano de Desenvolvimento Sustent√°vel‚Äù or PDS in Portuguese) is created with the technical support and direction from BMV. In this document are present all the investment guidelines towards the implementation of a sustainable land-use economic model. Based on thorough research and dialogue with the community, it presents an alternative for land occupation that relies largely on extensive areas of human interference.

The objectives and premises of the SDPs stem from a main premise: that the more economic pressure is felt by farmers, the more risk is presented to legal reserves and protection areas. This is not a reality only in the areas of influence of the Nuclei, but of all Western and Northern Brazil, where the crops and livestock yields are lower than in the rest of the country, combined with greatly increased costs due to logistics and lack of locally available workforce. It‚Äôs been observed, mainly for livestock breeding, that farmers compensate for the lack of land-use efficiency - or the lack of knowledge of more viable alternatives - advancing towards protected areas.<mark style="color:blue;">\[1]</mark>

Thus, to limit and reduce the size of degraded areas is paramount that the land legally destined for production increases in productivity and viability. In our view it is only possible through better practices, techniques and qualification of human capital to apply it. Because we are in constant interaction with scientific institutes, such as UNESP, BMV is able to indicate what are the best available technologies that are viable and produce the best cost-benefit return for the region of a Nuclei, which are indicated in the SDPs. However, it can only be applicable in the terrain with local workforce that is prepared and trained and within communities that are well structured socially and economically.

Based on this context, the investment defined in the SPDs for each Nucleus can be distinguished in three main areas: (i) an Environmental Management System; (ii) Local Development Structures and; (iii) Education and professional qualification.

The Environmental Management System is created even before the origination of the UCS from a given Nucleus, and its efforts are supported initially by BMV. It comprehends the assessment of _in loco_ features, such as adequacy to the Brazilian regulatory framework for agriculture - including Environmental regulation - and all the steps necessary to demonstrate to third parties of its adequacy. An Environmental Policy is enforced to the participants and the managers of the system pursue mitigation actions for identified risks, such as the Guidelines for the Combat and Prevention of Forest Fires, applicable to all current Nuclei. As the projects are implemented, new and successive phases are adopted, including but not limited to: close contact with public and regulatory bodies, periodical assessments of compliance, training persons of interest in Sustainability Development practices and creating awareness for the community.

The Local Development Structures are to be fully funded by UCS revenues and contribute to the overall development of the area of influence of the Nucleus. They are bricks-and-mortars businesses models that enhance the value added of the local production and grant a collective benefit, not only to the farmers, but for the economy in general, through payment of taxes locally and creation of qualified job posts. It‚Äôs intended to be a model for the food production in scale in a sustainable and ecological way. Some examples of these business are:

1. Packing Houses
2. Grains extracting and processing plants,
3. Grain silos,
4. Animal food plant
5. Timber treating and processing plant
6. Tourism-oriented hotel,
7. Flour industry
8. Meat cattle confinement
9. Shared milking parlor
10. Shared poultry husbandry
11. Shared swine husbandry
