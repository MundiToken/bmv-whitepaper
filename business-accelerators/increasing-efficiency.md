# ðŸªœ Increasing efficiency

BMV observed that in all Nuclei areas, the livestock husbandry areas suffer from an advanced degrading process up to 40% of that area, resulting from intensive grazing without the support of any culture treating or management.<mark style="color:blue;">\[3]</mark> This widespread practice leads to overall agro ecological impoverishment of the regions, besides being much less productive (in some cases 0,8 animal by hectare). The solutions brought by the SPDs are capable of achieving a fivefold productivity increase at the same time that recovers all of the degraded areas. <mark style="color:blue;">\[4]</mark>

Semi-intensive production systems can be immediately implemented in view of the local characteristics of the Nuclei. They rely also on grazing but with rational rotation systems, that enhance overall productivity of the farm. The rotation and resting time designated for each area allow natural recovery of vegetation and is designed to avoid energy wasting. It is based in a software driven management of the land, that uses economical and biological indexes to help the decision-making of farmers on a daily basis.

The growing demand for food, bioenergy and forest products, in the face of the need to reduce deforestation and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, requires solutions that conciliate socioeconomic development and sustainability of natural resources. Intensified land use in agricultural areas and increased efficiency of productive systems can contribute to harmonize these interests.\[5] Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest (ICLF) Systems can be used then to combine increasing of productivity with the conservation of natural resources. It can be applied in four different settings: Agro-pasture, forest-pasture, agroforestry or full integrated crop-livestock-forest system. The efficiency of the system relies on the optimization of plant and animal biological cycles, as from feedstock and waste.

The main advantages for the environment are the improvement of the soil, water use and reduced GHG emissions.

At the moment of implementation of the projects the total area used for livestock husbandry in the Nuclei (except for AmapÃ¡) is reduced by -51% in total, from 111,056 to 54,294 hectare.

On the other hand, meat and dairy production are increased, by 109% and 225%, respectively:

The productivity of crops is enhanced through the assessment of nutritional and climate requirements for each species, location and biome. Besides the rotation above mentioned between crops, livestock and forestry, the rotation of cultures in permanent areas also shows good results in overall productivity. A 5 year plan for the cultures is provided by BMV for the start of the project and, based on new data and soil conditions, new guidelines are to be provided. The main goal of the beans crops is to create input for the livestock husbandry activities.

To keep up with supply requirements, the area used for grains crops is raised by 100%, while production raises by 162%, mostly in consequence of livestock-crop integration use of land.

For the Nucleus AmapÃ¡ the application of the sustainable practices within the framework of a Production Matrix is expected to change the current area intensive production systems to a transformation system, that creates added value in the territory. The increase in production capacity takes place inside areas already destined to primary production, which reduces the pressure for the deforestation of new areas. It relies also in a waterway based logistic system, capable for the flow off the production, mainly to export.

The expected production of the Production Matrix in AmapÃ¡ is as follows:

| **Products**       | **Quantity (ton.)** |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Soy                | 800 000             |
| Corn               | 400 000             |
| Soy bran           | 44 200              |
| Animal food (beef) | 260 000             |
| Soy oil            | 120 000             |
| Meat               | 136 000             |
| Cheese             | 7 784               |
| Gelatine           | 1 018               |
| Finished leather   | 1 357               |

Besides these two main economic activities, otherminor primary productions included in the SPDs are pisciculture, manioc culture, and timber forestry. These activities are equally subject to environmental and social requirements applicable .
