# üåê Global strategy

Due to the international recognition of the work and achievements of the BMV network throughout the world, we spread our teams and engaged in projects in many other countries.

In Europe, BMV Portugal was established in 2017 and developed a matching strategy and methodology to be used for the origination of units in the Iberian Peninsula and further across Europe.

In the ICO, BMV Portugal will be responsible for the Token management and for controlling all the aspects of the Token structure. It will be the bridge between the UCS and purchasers that show a great appetite for qualified and innovative products in the European Continent.

Initially, all the UCS represented in the Tokens will be from Forest Credits, originated in forest preservation activities. Notwithstanding, the demand for social and environmental solutions specialized for the European reality has turned our head to a customized solution and methodology for each region. Public entities are currently asking for a holistic approach of conservation that integrates environmental, social and cultural aspects, and at the same time structure the demand for these assets on a national level.
