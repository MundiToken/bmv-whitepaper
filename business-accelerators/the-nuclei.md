# ðŸŒŽ The Nuclei

While the resources from the UCS are essential to reach our environmental protection goal, even more important is how they are applied and how to maximize its returns. It should be an investment that creates sustained and durable benefits, and that enable people to keep committed to responsible production. It should also create benefits that go beyond environmental protection, because when basic human rights and conditions of decent life are not present, the case for sustainable development is much harder to make.

On the other hand, the UCS providers i.e. farmers, should be accountable and responsible for the maintenance of native forest, healthy water sources and biodiversity in the limits of their properties, as they are ultimately their guardians.

Based on the cooperativism culture that is widespread and well accepted in the Brazilian agricultural and livestock reality, BMV created a holistic approach through the creation of an association that represents and supervises the landowners, while guiding the application of resources in the most economically optimal way within the framework of sustainable development.

Each Nucleus of the BMV System is a legally constituted person, in the form of association of all the signing farmers of a determined region that wish to participate in the proposed production transformation process: from outdated and harmful to new, technology-driven and sustainable practices. It manages the whole structure concerted in the Sustainability Development Plan devised individually for each Nucleus, besides providing and assisting in the implementation of the production and social guidelines contained therein, all of which will be further detailed below. The central concept is that social organization and mobilization towards an effective production chain, combined with the investments in technology and know-how enabled by the UCS revenue stream should improve economic and social features of the region, which, consequently reduces the pressure upon farmers to advance the production to forest areas.

In total, the BMV system comprises five Nuclei. They are Xingu Mata Viva, Teles Pires Mata Viva, Arinos Mata Viva, Madeira Mata Viva and AmapÃ¡.
