# ðŸ”– NFT Certifications

### <mark style="color:purple;">A word on NFTs</mark>

NFTs are unique certificates of authenticity on blockchains that are usually issued by the creators of the underlying assets. These assets can be digital or physical in nature. Fungible goods such as money or trade goods can be exchanged for goods of the same kind. By contrast, non-fungible items cannot be exchanged for a similar good because their value exceeds the actual material value.&#x20;

Examples from the analogue world include items of artistic or historical significance, or rare trading cardsâ€”all of which have a long history of trading in auctions and other marketplaces. In the digital world, it has so far been difficult to trade and auction nonfungible goods as their authenticity was hard to verify. NFTs now pave the way for the digitization and trade of unique values on the internet.&#x20;

Like cryptocurrency and other types of tokens, NFTs rely on blockchain technology and smart contracts as their digital infrastructure. however, they significantly differ from traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum in other respects. NFTs serve not as a currency, a commodity or a technology but as an asset.
